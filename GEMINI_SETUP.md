2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Create a new API key**
4. **Copy the API key** (keep it secure)

### **Step 2: Add API Key to NEXAA**

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
1. Create `.env` file in your project root
2. Add: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here`
3. Restart your development server

**Option B: Direct in Code (Quick Test)**
1. Open `src/components/NEXAA.jsx`
2. Find line 48: `const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY || 'your_gemini_api_key_here';`
3. Replace `'your_gemini_api_key_here'` with your actual API key

### **Step 3: Test NEXAA**

1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open NEXAA** (click the floating button)
3. **Check status indicator**:
   - ðŸŸ¢ **Green dot** = Gemini AI enabled
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow dot** = Fallback mode (no API key)

## ðŸŽ¯ **How Continuous Logic Works:**
